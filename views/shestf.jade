        hr
        p During my time at the 
          a(href="http://startupinstitute.com") Startup Institute 
          | of NY my team and I won 1st place in an 
          | idea hackathon for NY based start-up 
          a(href="http://shesthefirst.com", target="_blank") She's the First
          |. She's the First provides scholarships to girls in low-income countries with the goal
          | of creating first-generation graduates and the next generation of global leaders. My 
          | team was tasked with creating a fundraising event from idea to conception.
          
        p Wanting to create a strong call to action, I named the event "Be the First". I was responsible 
         | for aiding my team in all aspects of design but specifically created the events homepage 
         | where potential investors could learn more about their cause and RSVP for the event. I used custom   
         | bootstrap for the responsive layout and Photoshop for all image editing. 
         
        p The event was a success and although the webpage is no longer live you can learn more about the 
          | company and it's mission 
          a(href="http://shesthefirst.com", target="_blank") here
          |.
